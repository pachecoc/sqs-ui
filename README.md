# üì® SQS UI

A lightweight web UI + Go backend to inspect and interact with **AWS SQS** queues.

> **Note:** This repository is under active development. It is not production ready.

---

## ‚ú® 0.2.0 Highlights (since 0.1.x)

- Runtime queue switch dialog (update queue name or full queue URL without restarting).
- Improved message sending flow with countdown + advisory about AWS SQS metric lag.
- UI advisory about eventual consistency (counts may lag or exclude in-flight messages).
- Consistent error panels and simplified Tailwind classes for readability.
- Purge + config update actions auto-clear message panel.
- Optional labels & OCI metadata in Dockerfile.

## üíª UI Features

- Fetch queue info (region, URL, approximate counts, status).
- Receive (peek) messages (non-destructive unless backend deletes‚Äîsee notes).
- Send a message with post-send automatic refresh.
- Purge all messages (dangerous, explicit confirmation).
- Change queue at runtime (name or full URL).
- Advisory on SQS eventual consistency after refresh.
- Responsive Tailwind layout, no frameworks.

## üèÉ Run Locally

```bash
# Using Makefile (ensure a queue exists or credentials allow create)
export QUEUE_NAME=my-queue
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_PROFILE=example
make run-local
# Open:
http://localhost:8080
```

Direct go build:
```bash
go build -o sqs-ui ./cmd/server
./sqs-ui
```

---

## üê≥ Docker Usage

Pull & run:
```bash
# Full configs if they are already exported; if not, add them explicitly
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e QUEUE_NAME=my-queue \
  -e AWS_REGION \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  --name sqs-ui \
  pachecoc/sqs-ui:0.2.0

# If AWS SSO / temp creds, you can still start without queue name or URL but UI will show an error until set
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e AWS_REGION \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
  --name sqs-ui \
  pachecoc/sqs-ui:0.2.0
```

## üîê Credentials & Security

- Best: Use EKS Pod Identities or IAM roles (EC2, ECS, IRSA, etc.).
- Avoid committing credentials.
- Distroless image runs as non-root.
- Consider a read-only role if you do not need Send/Purge in certain deployments.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è SQS Semantics & Consistency

- `NumberOfMessages` is eventually consistent; newly sent or received messages may not reflect instantly.
- Receiving messages makes them temporarily invisible for their visibility timeout; they are not deleted unless explicitly deleted (or your server logic deletes on receive‚Äîverify your implementation[...]
- Purge is asynchronous; large queues may take seconds to clear.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Why do counts not update immediately after sending a message?**  
SQS attributes are approximate and eventually consistent; refresh again after a few seconds.

**Why did a fetched message ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù?**  
It‚Äôs in-flight (invisible) due to receive; it reappears after the visibility timeout unless deleted.

**Can I view messages without impacting visibility?**  
Pure ‚Äúpeek‚Äù isn‚Äôt natively supported by SQS. Standard receive temporarily hides messages.
